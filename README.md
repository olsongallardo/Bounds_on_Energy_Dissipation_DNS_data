# Bounds_on_Energy_Dissipation_DNS_data
Contains all data from DNS as well as explanation on what different files mean, figures and the Masters Dissertation they were for

There is another readme.txt in the compressed file, but it is copied here for ease of reading
Data from Direct Numerical Simulations for a range of Re tau between 60 and 140

Data produced when working towards my final year proyect at Imperial College London

HOW TO INTERPRET THIS DATA
There are various folders of the form of 3dv2*, 3d indicating that it is a three dimensional simulation

Each one contains figures with Ubar, the RMS data and the Reynolds stress -u'w'
On top of that, each folder also includes the raw data from the DNS, as well as the output files of my modifications

Diablo does not provide a documentation, so I had to make a small one, although rather cryptic. It is attached, but if you want more information about a specific output, email me
